          Hello World! My name is Thomas J.(TJ) Bongiorno. I am a 25yr old male from Staten Island,NY. I graduated from Monmouth University in 2013 and am now pursuing a career in Web Development. My hobbies and interests include: Working out, Soccer, Gaming, Fishing, Martial Arts, Reading, Writing, Chess and (most importantly) CODING! My favorite movie is: The Last Samurai. My favorite song is: a tie between Welcome Home by Coheed and Cambria and Don't You Worry Child by the Swedish House Mafia. My biggest regret: I put through a design patent to the "patent pending" stage. I didn't have the funds to pay for a patent or go through with my product and gave up.The exact product is now (almost 3 years later) everywhere.
